## Description
A small program that uses node.js to generate a READEME.md file based off of user inputs. This project was my introduction to node.js. With it, writing a README file is slightly more convenient.

## Installation
In order to use this program, node.js will need to be installed on your computer.

## Usage
If node.js is installed on your computer, type 'node index.js' in the command line located within the index file and hit enter. Proceed to fill out all of the prompts that appear in the console.
